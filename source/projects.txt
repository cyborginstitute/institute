Taskfile
--------

to compile lists of ``TODO`` items from a tree of files, such as those
created by a flat-file wiki like `ikiwiki`_ or `Gollum`_. Includes
example makefile examples, a deployment guide, and documentation.

   ``csc``, the Cyborg Site Compiler
   ---------------------------------

   ``csc`` springs from a collection of experiences with various
   available static site compilers. [#static-site-compilers]_ optimized
   for incremental builds, flexible indexing and page aggregation
   features.

   - `csc project page and documentation <http://cyborginstitute.com/projects/csc>`_
   - `csc source repo <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=csc.git>`_
   - `csc source repo on github <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/csc>`_

   .. [#static-site-compilers] "Static Site Compilers" are tools that
      generate websites based on templates and source files in a
      lightweight markup language.

stl, a Personal Logging Script
------------------------------

``stl`` (i.e. "stats logger") is a tool for managing, maintaining,
and logging work for writers. It provides a unified interface around
logging word count information, as well as compiling projects, and
other related functionality. If you publish text using software such
as `ikiwiki`_, `Sphinx`_, or using ad hoc Makefiles, ``stl`` may do
exactly what you want.

- `stl source repo <http://git.cyborginstitute.net/?p=stl.git>`_
- `stl source repo on github <http://github.com/cyborginstitute/stl>`_

---------------------------

"Stack," provides baseline configurations for a number of applications
(beginning with emacs and StumpWM,) presented as an example and
jumping off point for new users who want to build their own
configuration.
